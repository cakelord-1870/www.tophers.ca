<p>Plain old school sugar scrubs using a blend of oils and sugar are so last year. . . . At Topher's we have formulated a blend of foaming cream soap, moisturizing oils, butters and organic cane sugar.  The Foaming soap works to wash away dirt and oils on your skin, while the added skin friendly oils and tropical butters work to moisturize and replenish moisture as the sugar gently exfoliates and scrubs away dead and dry skin leaving you feeling and looking rejuvenated and glowing. Gentle enough for your whole body including your face, our scrubs will become your new favorite product to use in the shower.</p>
<p>First use as you would a sugar scrub and when you are done exfoliating, grab your cloth or shower poof and wash as you would with a cream soap.</p>
<p>8 oz in size.</p>
<p><span>Test on skin before use, may contain allergens.</span></p>
<p><em>Ingredients - <span>Sucrose, </span>Aqua, Glycerin, Sorbital, Sodium Cocoyl/Lauroyl Isethionate, Sorbitol Disodium Lauryl Sulfosuccinate, Fragrance, <span>Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, </span>Sodium Chloride, Levulinic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Soap Colorant.</em></p>
