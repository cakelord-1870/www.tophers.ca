    <td colspan="2"><p>Soaking in a bath is beneficial in many ways, not to mention relaxing and warm in the cold winter months.  Lemony Sunshine is the perfect blend of citrus and greenery with vibrant lemon citrus notes and uplifting lemongrass at its base it's sure to set the mood to happy!</p>
<p>The waters of the Dead Sea have been renowned for their therapeutic effects since ancient times. Two thousand years ago, Flavius wrote that the salts from the Dead Sea heal the human body.</p>
<p>The waters from the Dead Sea are unique in that they contain 27% of various salts as compared to 3% in normal sea water. Further, while sodium accounts for approximately 80% of the salt content of normal sea water, it comprises much less of the salt total in water from the Dead Sea. The balance of the salts in Dead Sea water are magnesium, potassium, calcium chloride and bromides.</p>
<p>Give yourself a spa like treatment in your own bathtub. A natural way to help your largest organ (the skin) begin the process of cleansing and renewal! Detoxifying Dead Sea Mineral Salts with Kaolin Clay are combined with pure essential oils to draw impurities from your skin while you soak in a relaxing bath. Using 100% natural Lavender, Cedarwood and Vetiver Essential Oils, this exotic Dead Sea bath salt helps to promote a peaceful and relaxed state to help you drift off to sleep.</p>
<p>Stir 2 - 4 tablespoons into a tub of warm water until in dissolves. Soak for 20 minutes, immersing your body, keeping the water at a consistent temperature and relax while the Dead Sea Salt minerals and the infused essential oils go to work.</p>
<p><em>Ingredients: Dead Sea Salts, Kaolin Clay, Eucalyptus Essential Oil,  Polysorbate 80, Polyester 3, Yellow 5.</em></p>

    <td colspan="2"><p>​​​The Dead Sea is the most saline body of water in the world with a mineral concentration of approximately 32%, according to The Dead Sea Research Center at the Ben Gurion University of the Negev. Mud from the Dead Sea has a high content of salts and minerals that are claimed to be essential for the body, and it is widely used in Pelotherapy. </p>
<p>Dead Sea Mud has been known to aid in removing toxins and impurities from the skin, tightening and toning the complexion, and improving blood circulation, which may in turn aid in cell regeneration.  Great for an anti acne treatment.</p>
<p>Give yourself a home spa treatment at a fraction of the cost of going to a salon. Following the rule of less is more, spread a thin layer of mud on your face using your fingers or a brush and allow 15 to 20 minutes for it to dry. Gently wash away with warm water and pat dry. Apply your favorite moisturizer and enjoy the healthy glow. May be used as a body mask as well. </p>
<p>This is for a 8oz plastic recyclable jar or 2 oz resealable pouch with 100% Dead Sea Mud and pure therapeutic grade Frankincense + Lavender Essential Oils.</p>
<p>Always do a small skin test first to make certain your skin type can handle the strength of the mineral content + salt in this product. Many Dead Sea Mud Masks are diluted with water and/or fillers, Topher's Mud is pure + powerfully full of mineral content.</p></td>
