The resulting mineral-rich Dead Sea mud is a natural raw material that can be used by the body as a source of essential minerals for all its basic needs. We have also included in several different clays that help to pull toxins out through your skin while you wash to be rinsed away while you bathe. Proven to help with facial acne without drying out your skin like traditional acne treatments. Treat yourself to your own personal spa day at home with this clay and mud based soap. </span></p>

Other great benefits to hops, it soothes irritated skin, and contains polyphenols thought to account for its anti-bacterial and preservative effects, and also it contains skin-softening amino acids. Nor does it smell like beer. Lightly scented with Oats and Honey.</span></p>
<p>This long lasting, silky bar is full of plant based oils and butters that gently clean, are never drying and great for skin conditioning and health while the clay in each bar helps to pull impurities and extra oils to the surface to be rinsed away with the creamy lather.  We cut each at roughly 4.5 - 5 oz bars.</p>
<p>We make our soaps the old fashioned way in small batches to control quality. These palm oil and cruelty free soap bars contain no palm oil, lard or tallow and are never tested on animals, only on me.</p>
<p><span>Our</span><span> cold process, small batch soap is made using a combination of Coconut oil, Shea butter, Sunflower oil, Canola oil, </span><span>Olive oil, Castor oil, Sodium Hydroxide(Lye), Select Clay, Essential oils and/or phthalate free Fragrance oil. No harsh chemical detergents.</span></p>

<p>This long lasting, silky bar is full of plant based oils and butters that gently clean, are never drying and great for skin conditioning and health while the clay in each bar helps to pull impurities and extra oils to the surface to be rinsed away with the creamy lather.  We cut each at roughly 4.5 - 5 oz bars.</p>
