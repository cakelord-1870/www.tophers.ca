<p>We partnered up with a local mask maker and after a few prototypes and some trial and error, the Beard Poncho was born.  Reversible, 100% cotton, with adjustable ear straps and wire in the nose area make this a great fitting, comfortable alternative to the other masks available while still keeping you and others safe, and the best part, no beard crease.</p>
